Explain forum structure top down:
A category is a group of forums
A forum is a group of threads
A thread is a group of posts

Examples:
Category "discussions" can include forums like "pets", "vehicles", "fishing"
Each forum will include threads related to the forum topic
"pets" might contain "cats", "dogs", "fish"
Johnny Dipshit can create posts about his stupid dog under discussions>pets>dogs

See demo-data-and-usage.ts
Real dummy data with some more properties is at src/data.json
The real dummy data should match what we'll have when we migrate to google firestore
