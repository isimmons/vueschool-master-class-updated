# Esplainin dis mess

Going through the vueschool Vue.js 3 Masterclass because while Reacting I forgot how to Vue
I just managed to get working dev tools on my account at work (IT controlled Windows shop that has no interest in employees doing software development) so I put this in a repo really just for the purpose of working on it while on break at my regular job.

## I may or my not remove this repo in the future

## What tha hayell CSS!?

Yeah I don't like the way this instructor did the CSS but it's typical of course material and it's not the focus at the moment. But project is 75% CSS? I thought this was a TS project lol.

Started project with vite@latest vue-ts template. Staying close enough to original project to be able to follow along but kinda doing my own thing too.

Having issues with TS not recognizing .vue files as modules so I added/removed the vue-shim.d.ts file multiple times because it would work and then it would not work.

I think the problem is something hogging resources and causing volar to stop working. If I reload the project it starts recognizing vue files as modules. Anyways, looking into it.

### Random notes while working
